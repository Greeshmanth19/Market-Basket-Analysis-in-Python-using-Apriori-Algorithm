# Market-Basket-Analysis-in-Python-using-Apriori-Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing Market Basket Analysis (MBA) using the Apriori algorithm. MBA is a data mining technique used to discover patterns in customers' purchasing habits. It helps identify associations and correlations between products frequently purchased together, which is valuable for business decisions like product placement and targeted marketing.

## Introduction

Market Basket Analysis is widely used in retail and e-commerce for:

- **Cross-selling:** Recommending related products to customers.
- **Inventory Management:** Optimizing product placement and stocking.
- **Pricing Strategies:** Identifying bundles and discounts that drive sales.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Understanding customer behavior.

## Apriori Algorithm

The Apriori algorithm is a popular method for performing Market Basket Analysis. It works by finding frequent itemsets in transaction data and generating association rules. This repository includes Python code that implements the Apriori algorithm.

## Usage

To run the Market Basket Analysis using Apriori:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/market-basket-analysis.git`
2. Run the analysis: `python market_basket_analysis.py`

You can adjust parameters like minimum support and confidence levels to customize the analysis.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis is provided in the below link. You can replace it with your own transaction data in CSV format.

## Results

After running the analysis, you will obtain association rules that reveal patterns in the data, such as "Customers who buy Product A are likely to buy Product B." Use these insights to inform business decisions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- mlxtend (for Apriori implementation)
- matplotlib (for visualization)

Install these dependencies using `pip` as mentioned in the usage section.
